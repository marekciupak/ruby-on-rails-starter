# Preparing the environment for application development in Ruby on Rails

## For Windows

### 1. Install Docker

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

We will use it to isolate all the software, required to run our app, into a virtual container. This is a simple way to
ensure that each of us will be using the same version of the software and libraries.

Install Docker Toolbox from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox.

### 2. Install Git

Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among
multiple people.

We will use it to track all the changes that you make in the code.

Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win.

### 3. Install JetBrains RubyMine

JetBrains RubyMine is an integrated development environment for creating software in Ruby.

Install it from https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/.
